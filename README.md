# sudoku-generator
A simple Sudoku matrix generator.

It contains all the necessary functions to generate a list consisting of nine lists, each constituting a single row. The sudoku matrices are random.
The generator uses a backtracking algorithm and is pretty fast.

This is my very first thing to put on GitHub! :D
